            <p>The Akan people of <strong>Ghana</strong> frequently name their children after the <br> day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. <br> These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and <br> character of the person. Middle names have considerably more variety <br> and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.</p>
