        <div class="descript">
            <p>The Akan people of <strong>Ghana</strong> frequently name their children after the <br> day of the week they were born and the order in which they were born. <br> These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and <br> character of the person. Middle names have considerably more variety <br> and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.</p>

                  <p class="font--cabin">Lobster is bold and beautiful while remaining quite readable, attributes not easily found in other scripts. To complement this strong statement, you donâ€™t want anything that competes for attention. Instead pick something plain and simple like Cabin.</p>

                  <p class="font--gentium">Pairing two serif typefaces is often considered bad practice, but this is a case where we can get away with breaking the rules of typography. Eczar and Gentium Basic share an extremely similar structure, yet they are different enough to still contrast with one another.</p>
